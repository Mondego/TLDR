TLRD is an opensource Regression Test Selection (RTS) tool with minimal selection overhead. It is a maven plugin that selects minimum number of test cases and yet maintains safety during incremental development. This plugin can be run in tandem with JUnit. For this tool user needs to install JUnit 4.11 and Surefire 2.17.3.

The project is currently under construction. Details will follow as we continue to build it. We aren't welcoming contribution just yet.

If you have any question, suggestions, or concerns about the tool feel free to email mzaber at uci dot edu
